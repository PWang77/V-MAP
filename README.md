# V-MAP

### What is it?
V-MAP is a COVID-19 visualizer used to optimize vaccination plans. It simulates the spread of COVID-19 in India while taking into account susceptible, recovered, and infected populations (SIR model), alongside the current death rate.

### Why is it relevant? 
V-MAP combats virus and vaccine related misinformation and creates an effective plan for vaccine rollout. By targeting the general public, it eases social, ethical, and political unrest amidst the critical state of India's healthcare system.
