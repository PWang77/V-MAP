# V-MAP

### ⚡What is it?
V-MAP is a COVID-19 visualizer used to optimize vaccination plans. It simulates the spread of COVID-19 in India while taking into account susceptible, infected, and recovered populations, alongside the current death rate.

### ⚡Why is it relevant? 
V-MAP combats virus and vaccine related misinformation and provides the tools necessary to create an effective plan for vaccine rollout. By targeting the general public, it eases social, ethical, and political unrest amidst the critical state of India's healthcare system.

### ⚡How does it work?
V-MAP uses real incidence datasets to investigate various unique parameters of the outbreak and the effects of intervention strategies in India. Our modelling approach is rooted in the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, which provides a theoretical framework to investigate the spread of an epidemic within a community. This mathematical model utilizes differential equations to compute the theoretical number of people infected in a closed population over time. Users can interact with the map to customize states, vaccine rollout plans, and days settings for the visualizer results.
